## Beginning Data preparing

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
original_tbl <- read.csv("./NBA-BoxScores-2023-2024.csv")


original_tbl <- mutate(original_tbl,
                       START_POSITION = na_if(START_POSITION, ""),
                       START_POSITION = factor(original_tbl$START_POSITION),
                       COMMENT = na_if(COMMENT, ""),
                       COMMENT = factor(original_tbl$COMMENT),
                       MIN = na_if(MIN, ""),
                       MIN = str_replace(MIN, "([0-9]+)\\.[0-9]+:", "\\1:"),
                       )

starting_dat = original_tbl[original_tbl$START_POSITION != "",]
lebron_vs_steph_games = c(22300650, 22300973, 22301155)

# Code to add in opposing team

```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
## Ben's DRTG code!
# Calculate total points per team per game

team_points <- na.omit(original_tbl) %>%

DRTG data being joined to the starting data

```{r, warning=FALSE}
## NOW ADDING DRTG vars to original_tbl


# Each team plays one opponent per game, so we pair them like this:

# Join to get each game twice: once for each team, with their opponent
opponent_map <- game_team_pairs %>%
  inner_join(game_team_pairs, by = "GAME_ID") %>%
  filter(TEAM_ID.x != TEAM_ID.y) %>%
  rename(TEAM_ID = TEAM_ID.x, OPP_TEAM_ID = TEAM_ID.y)

# Add opponent DRTG to the mapping
opponent_map <- opponent_map %>%
  left_join(team_drtg %>% rename(OPP_TEAM_ID = TEAM_ID, OPP_DRTG = DRTG_proxy),
            by = "OPP_TEAM_ID")

# Join to add opponent DRTG column to the full data

## Model 1 implementation

Situation: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
  y_{ijk} &\sim Binom(n_{ijk}, p_{ik})\\
  n_{ijk} &\sim \text{by model}\\
  p_{ik} &= p_i \times \text{exp}(\gamma (\text{DRTG}_k - \bar{\text{DRTG}}))\\
  p_{i} &\sim Beta(5,5)
\end{aligned}
$$

Set up

```{r}
lebron_dat = starting_dat[starting_dat$PLAYER_ID %in% 2544, ]
model_1_dat = lebron_dat[lebron_dat$GAME_ID %in% lebron_vs_steph_games,] # This basically turned out to be too small of a dataset to do much with...
Y = lebron_dat$FGM
N = nrow(lebron_dat)
true_p = mean(lebron_dat$FG_PCT)
n_median = median(lebron_dat$FGA)
```

Metropolis Hastings implementation

```{r}
#This is the uhhhh posterior I think
log_q = function(theta, y=3, n=10) {
  if (theta<0 | theta>1) return(-Inf)
  (y-0.5)*log(theta)+(n-y-0.5)*log(1-theta)
}

# This runs the Metropolis hastings algorithm
MH_beta_binom = function(current = 0.5, prop_sd, n = n) {
  current = 0.5 # Initial value
  samps = rep(NA,N)
  for (i in 1:N) {
    proposed = rnorm(1, current, prop_sd) # tuning parameter goes here
    logr = log_q(proposed, y=Y[i], n=n)-log_q(current, y=Y[i], n=n)
    if (log(runif(1)) < logr) current = proposed #comparitor
    samps[i] = current
  }
  paste("Acceptance Rate: ", length(unique(samps))/n)
  return(samps)
}

# This is such a grid search of the MH using a variety of Proposed SDs
# and choosing the best one to maximize the effective sample size
MH_beta_grid_serach = function(current = 0.5, n) {
  vals = seq(from=0.01, to = 20, by = 0.01)
  effect_sizes = data.frame(sd = vals, effect_size = NA)
  for (i in 1:length(vals)) {
    samps = MH_beta_binom(prop_sd = vals[i], n=n)
    effect_sizes[i,2] = effectiveSize(samps)
  }
  best_sd = effect_sizes$sd[effect_sizes$effect_size == max(effect_sizes$effect_size)] #select best sd option
  return(MH_beta_binom(prop_sd = best_sd, n=n))
}
```


So basically, I don't think I did the predictive posterior correctly. And also, we have low ESS and the y's don't fit the best! For shame team, for shame.

```{r}

n_mean = round(mean(lebron_dat$FGA)) #NAs casue mean is not an integer
samps = MH_beta_grid_serach(n=n_mean)
yhat <- rbinom(1000, n_mean, mean(samps))
hist(yhat)
abline(v = mean(Y), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```


```{r}
n_median = median(lebron_dat$FGA)
samps = MH_beta_grid_serach(n=n_median)
yhat <- rbinom(1000, n_median, mean(samps))
hist(yhat)
abline(v = mean(Y), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{r}
n_max = max(lebron_dat$FGA)
samps = MH_beta_grid_serach(n=n_max)
yhat <- rbinom(1000, n_max, mean(samps))
hist(yhat)
abline(v = mean(Y), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```
